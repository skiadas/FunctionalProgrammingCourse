<h1 id="compound-haskell-types">Compound Haskell Types</h1>
<h3 id="compound-types">Compound Types</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways of producing more complex types out of simpler types. These are some times called <strong>compound types</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="list-types">List Types</h4>
<p>The first example of that is the list type. As elements of the list all must have the same type, we can specify the type of a list with two pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that it is a list. This is denoted by using a single pair of square brackets: <code>[...]</code></li>
<li>The fact that the entries have a certain type. That type goes between the brackets.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="haskell"><code>[False, True, True, True] :: [Bool]
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;] :: [Char]            -- Can also be called String
&quot;abc&quot; :: [Char]                      -- Same as above
[&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;] :: [[Char]]           -- Or also [String]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: Write a value of type <code>[[Int]]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="tuple-types">Tuple Types</h4>
<p>A <strong>tuple</strong> is a collection of values separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses. Unlike lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tuple has a fixed number of elements (fixed <em>arity</em>), either zero or at least two.</li>
<li>The elements can have different types, from each other.</li>
<li>The types of each of the elements collectively form the type of the tuple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>(False, 3) :: (Bool, Int)
(3, False) :: (Int, Bool)    -- This is different from the one above
(True, True, &quot;dat&quot;)  :: (Bool, Bool, [Char])
() :: ()                     -- The empty tuple, with the empty tuple type</code></pre>
<p>We write functions for tuples by using what is known as <strong>pattern-matching</strong>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>isBetween :: (Int, Int) -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
isBetween (a, b) c = a &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= b

-- Example use:    isBetween (2, 5) 3  returns true</code></pre>
<p>What is happening in the example is that the pair <code>(2, 5)</code> is <em>matched</em> against the <em>pattern</em> <code>(a, b)</code> and as a result <code>a</code> is set to <code>2</code> and <code>b</code> is set to <code>5</code>. The pair is still considered a single input to the function (thus making two inputs together with the other integer), but it ends up having its parts bound to different variables via the pattern-matching process. We will return to this soon.</p>
<p>We can also mix list types and tuple types. For instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>[(1, 2), (0, 2), (3, 4)] :: [(Int, Int)]       --   A list of pairs of integers
 -- A list of pairs of strings and booleans
[(&quot;Peter&quot;, True), (&quot;Jane&quot;, False)] :: [([Char], Bool)]</code></pre>
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>Write the types we might use to represent the following information:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A person with first and last name, age, and information about whether they can drive or not.</li>
<li>Many persons as in the previous part.</li>
<li>The record of a college student, containing their name, username, and a list of the courses they have taken and the grades.</li>
<li>The ingredients for a recipe.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="function-types">Function types</h4>
<p>A function type is written as <code>A -&gt; B</code> where <code>A</code> is the type of the input and <code>B</code> is the type of the output. For example:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>add3 x = x + 3           :: Int -&gt; Int
add (x, y) = x + y       :: (Int, Int) -&gt; Int
oneUpTo n = [1..n]       :: Int -&gt; [Int]
range (a, b) = [a..b]    :: (Int, Int) -&gt; [Int]</code></pre>
<p>When writing functions, we tend to declare their type right before their definition, like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>range :: (Int, Int) -&gt; [Int]
range (a, b) = [a..b]</code></pre>
<p>You may be tempted to think of this function as a function of two variables. It technically is not, and we will discuss this topic on the next section.</p>
<h3 id="type-practice">Type Practice</h3>
<p>Work out the types of the following expressions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>(5 &gt; 3, 3 + head [1, 2, 3])</code></li>
<li><code>[length "abc"]</code></li>
<li>The function <code>f</code> defined by <code>f lst = length lst + head lst</code></li>
<li>The function <code>g</code> defined by <code>g lst = if head lst then 5 else 3</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Write the types for the following functions:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>A function that takes as input a list of integers and returns the list but sorted.</li>
<li>A function that is given a list of numbers and returns the smallest and largest number.</li>
<li>A function that takes as input a pair of “ranges”, where a “range” is itself a pair of integers, and returns whether the first range is contained in the other.</li>
<li>A function that takes as input a list of people names and ages as well as a cutoff age, and returns a list of the names for those people whose age passes the cutoff.</li>
</ol>
