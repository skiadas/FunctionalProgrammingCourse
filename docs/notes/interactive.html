<h1 id="interactive-programming-in-haskell">Interactive Programming in Haskell</h1>
<p>In this section we discuss the challenge of creating interactive applications in Haskell, and how Haskell addresses the problem.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-programming-in-a-pure-world">Interactive Programming in a Pure World</h2>
<p>In Haskell all functions are <strong>pure</strong>, which means that their outputs are completely determined by their inputs. This is a wonderful feature that provides numerous guarantees. We can more easily argue about the correctness of a program if we know exactly what the results will be.</p>
<p>By contrast, interacting with the user requires that we break this purity. If the user is expected to type some string in, how can our function return a predictable result? And what about functions that print something to the screen? Each time we run the function, a new “effect” is produced, as a new string is printed to the screen. This is in addition to and distinct from whatever return value the function might produce.</p>
<p>So the question becomes how to represent such a situation, when our language does not allow such “side-effects”. The answer is with a new type:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>type IO a</code></pre>
<p>So a value of type <code>IO a</code> interacts with the “world” in some way and also produces a value of type <code>a</code>. We can now write the types of two key functions:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>getChar :: IO Char
putChar :: Char -&gt; IO ()</code></pre>
<p>So <code>getChar</code> is an <code>IO Char</code> type: It interacts with the user in some way (reading a character) and returns a value of type <code>Char</code>. <code>putChar</code> on the other hand takes as input a character and produces an interaction with the user (i.e. printing the character), where this interaction doesn’t produce anything.</p>
<p>We can test a simple interaction this way (we will explain <code>do</code> in a minute):</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>main :: IO ()
main = do
    x &lt;- getChar
    putChar x</code></pre>
<p>If we load this and type <code>main</code>, then the interface will wait for us to type a character, then echo that character back to us before exiting. Try it out!</p>
<p>Some other useful functions, you can probably guess what they do, but make surey you understand the <em>types</em>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>getLine :: IO String
putStr :: String -&gt; IO ()
putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
print :: (Show a) =&gt; a -&gt; IO ()</code></pre>
<p>Values of type <code>IO a</code> are called <strong>actions</strong>. They are “impure” in the sense that their results depend on external factors such as user interaction, and as such they cannot be used inside of “pure” functions. What this means in practical terms is that we cannot get the value of type <code>a</code> completely out of its <code>IO</code> context: There is no function of type <code>IO a -&gt; a</code> that we can make. Once you are in IO you are stuck there.</p>
<p>So the main idea of working with interactive programming is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put as much of your code as possible in pure functions.</li>
<li>Use small IO actions where you need user interaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-do-notation-combining-actions">The Do notation: Combining Actions</h3>
<p>In order to write more complicated actions we need a way of combining primitive actions together. The <code>do</code> notation is very handy there. The <code>do</code> notation looks like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>myNewAction = do
    action1
    x &lt;- action2
    action3
    action4</code></pre>
<p>So it consists of a series of actions, and it executes these actions in order. An action could instead have an assignment like <code>x &lt;- action2</code> above, meaning that the result of the action should be stored in the variable <code>x</code>, which then becomes available to the followup actions (<code>action3</code> and <code>action4</code> in the preceding example).</p>
<p>For example, let’s write an action <code>getLine</code>. It reads characters until it encounters the newline character. It then creates a string from all those characters. It has type <code>IO String</code>. Here is the logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>We read a character.</li>
<li>If the character is not the newline, then we recursively call ourselves to read the rest of the line, then prepend our character to the front.</li>
<li>If the character is the newline, then we need to return an empty list/string, so that the process of prepending characters can begin.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above a key step is to be able to “return” a specific value, like a string. This means that we need to turn an actual value into an <em>action</em> that does not change the world but that contains this value as its value. This is done by a function aptly called <code>return</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>return :: a -&gt; IO a</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>return</code> simply takes a value and turns it into the trivial action.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the code for our <code>getLine</code> function:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>getLine :: IO String
getLine = do
    c &lt;- getChar
    if c == &#39;\n&#39;
        then return &quot;&quot;
        else do
            cs &lt;- getLine
            return (c:cs)</code></pre>
<p>So this example consists of 2 actions. The first is a call to <code>getChar</code>. The second action is the result of the <code>if-then-else</code> call, which depends on the character <code>c</code>. It is the <code>return ""</code> action if the character is the newline character, or it is an action defined via a <code>do</code> as the combination of two other actions, for any other character.</p>
<p>Let us similarly write a function that prints a string. It must take as input a string, and returns an action with no value.</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>putStr :: String -&gt; IO ()
putStr []     = return ()
putStr (c:cs) = do
    putChar c
    putStr cs</code></pre>
<p>There is also a version that follows the string with a newline:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
putStrLn s = do
    putStr s
    putChar &#39;\n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>All these are already implemented in Haskell, but even if they were not we could have easily added them.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let us consider another useful function, called <code>sequence_</code>. It has type:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>sequence_ :: [IO a] -&gt; IO ()</code></pre>
<p>It takes a list of actions, and it performs them in sequence, ignoring their results. It could be implemented as follows:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>sequence_ []       = return ()
sequence_ (ac:acs) = do ac
                        sequence_ acs</code></pre>
<p>You should notice a similarity between this function and <code>putStr</code> earlier. In fact, think of how you could implement <code>putStr</code> using <code>sequence_</code> and a list comprehension (or map) to form a list of actions out of a list of characters.</p>
<p>To show some more possibilities, let’s write a function that reads in a number if it’s the only thing on a line. We use here the special function <code>read</code> which converts a string to another kind of value, like an integer:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>getInt :: IO Int
getInt = do
    s &lt;- getLine
    return (read s)</code></pre>
<p>And here is an example usage:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>addUp :: IO ()
addUp = do
    i1 &lt;- getInt
    i2 &lt;- getInt
    putStrLn (&quot;The sum is: &quot; ++ show (i1 + i2))</code></pre>
<p>More complex example (do as time permits): Write an action that asks for an integer, then asks the user to type in that many numbers, and returns their sum, with some prompts along the way.</p>
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Implement an action that will ask for a line of input from the user and then test whether that line forms a palindrome or not, and return an appropriate message.</li>
<li>Implement a <code>prompt :: String -&gt; IO String</code> method which presents the provided prompt to the user, then reads a line of input (and returns that line as its value; <code>getLine</code> will take care of that part).</li>
<li>Implement <code>putStr</code> using <code>sequence_</code>. The types should help guide you in the process (You start with a <code>[Char]</code>, which you should turn into a <code>[IO ()]</code> before calling <code>sequence_</code>).</li>
<li>Implement a function <code>getWord :: IO String</code> that reads and returns a word (and stops when it encounters a non-word character. The built-in function <code>Data.Char.isAlpha :: Char -&gt; Bool</code> can tell you if a character is alphabetic.</li>
<li>Implement the action <code>sequence :: [IO a] -&gt; IO [a]</code>. It takes a list of actions, performs them all, and collects the results into one list.</li>
</ol>
<script type="text/javascript">
let els = document.getElementsByTagName("pre");
for (const el of els) {
  const lang = el.getAttribute("class");
  if (lang != "") {
      el.children[0].setAttribute("class", "language-"+lang);
  }
}
