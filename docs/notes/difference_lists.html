<h1 id="functions-as-values-difference-lists">Functions as Values: Difference Lists</h1>
<p>In this section we discuss an example where our primitive values are themselves functions. We will see Difference Lists, which are an approach to efficiently appending on the right.</p>
<p>We will also discuss the concept of function composition in this context.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Section 7.5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="difference-lists">Difference Lists</h2>
<p>We can already seen the list append operation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">(<span class="fu">++</span>)<span class="fu">:</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]
[] <span class="fu">++</span> ys        <span class="fu">=</span> ys
(x<span class="fu">:</span>xs) <span class="fu">++</span> ys    <span class="fu">=</span> x <span class="fu">:</span> (xs <span class="fu">++</span> ys)</code></pre></div>
<p>Looking at this a bit further it becomes clear that appending requires the copying of the entire first list, and therefore is affected by the length of the first list, but is is not at all affected by the length of the second list.</p>
<p>In general, lists are set up so that it is easy to add elements to their left, but not to their right.</p>
<p>But in many practical applications we want the opposite. Imagine reading through a configuration file and creating a resulting web page as you go. You will be constantly adding new entries to the end of the string, which corresponds to the right-side of a list. As the length of the string grows, adding one more character to the end becomes expensive as all the earlier parts get copied each time. We saw the same problem when we tried to reverse a list in a naive way.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is presented by difference lists. The idea of a difference list is that it does not try and do the appending right away, but it simply sets up something that will happen in the future. These steps are then performed in reverse order. For instance suppose that there are 4 strings to be added in total in this process, A, B, C, D. Instead of saying:</p>
<pre><code>Start with A
Append B to the end of A
Append C to the end of (A++B)
Append D to the end of ((A++B) ++ C) ++ D
Return the result</code></pre>
<p>We say:</p>
<pre><code>Remember that you will put A to the left of the remaining result.
Remember that you will put B to the left of the remaining result, before adding the A.
Remember that you will put C to the left of the remaining result, before adding the B.
Remember that you will put D to the left of the remaining result, before adding the C.
Since you have no more strings to add, start with an empty string [] and work backwards:
Add the D to []
Add the C to (D ++ [])
Add the B to (C ++ (D ++ []))
Add the A to (B ++ (C ++ (D ++ [])))
Return the result.</code></pre>
<p>So the key difference here is that the list appends end up happening from right to left, which is more efficient in the long run. But in order to achieve that, we had to delay the appending of the strings as we encountered them, until we reached the end.</p>
<p>This leads us to the structure of <em>difference lists</em>. A difference list is effectively a promise to append a list later:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">type</span> dList a <span class="fu">=</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]</code></pre></div>
<p>It is meant to say “You give me the rest of the list, and I’ll add the extra bits to it”. The actual value is a function, that is given a list representing the rest of the result and adjusts it, hopefully by adding its bit to the front.</p>
<p>We can now write two functions, to form a difference list from a list, or from a single element. The type for such a function would be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">fromList ::</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a</code></pre></div>
<p>If we unravel what this means, since <code>dList a</code> is simply functions <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code>, we get:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">fromList ::</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> ([a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a])
fromList xs  <span class="fu">=</span> \ys <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> xs <span class="fu">++</span> ys
<span class="co">-- Can also write as:</span>
fromList xs ys <span class="fu">=</span> xs <span class="fu">++</span> ys
<span class="co">-- Or even</span>
fromList <span class="fu">=</span> (<span class="fu">++</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>In this setting we are thinking of a list as a difference list by saying “I will prepend this list to any list you give me.”</p>
<p>Similarly for single elements we would have:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">fromElem ::</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a
fromElem x <span class="fu">=</span> \ys <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> x <span class="fu">:</span> ys
<span class="co">-- Can also write as:</span>
fromElem x ys <span class="fu">=</span> x <span class="fu">:</span> ys
<span class="co">-- Or even</span>
fromElem <span class="fu">=</span> (<span class="fu">:</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>So we think of a single element as a difference list by saying “I will prepend this element to any list you give me.”</p>
<p>We have encountered an important idea. These methods are our familiar <code>++</code> and <code>:</code> operators, but now considered in a new light because of the new types we have.</p>
<p>But still, we have not defined our most important operation, namely that of appending two lists together. Now we need to append two difference lists together. Remember that they are both functions. And we must also return a function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">append ::</span> dList a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a
<span class="co">-- If we &quot;unalias&quot;:</span>
<span class="ot">append ::</span> ([a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> ([a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> ([a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a])
append f1 f2 <span class="fu">=</span> \ys <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="fu">...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is probably the most complicated function we have written yet, in terms of types. Let us think of what it needs to do: It takes as input two difference lists, and it is supposed to produce a new difference list which amounts to appending <code>f2</code> at the end of <code>f1</code>. What we really mean by it, since we think of both lists instead as their effects on a list to their right, is that we should first do what <code>f2</code> asks us to do, then use <code>f1</code>. So the code ends up looking like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">append ::</span> dList a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> dList a
append f1 f2 <span class="fu">=</span> \ys <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> f1 (f2 ys)
<span class="co">-- Can also write:</span>
append f1 f2 ys <span class="fu">=</span> f1 (f2 ys)</code></pre></div>
<p>Let us see it in action in the example where both dLists came from lists. In order to think of their combination, we apply the dList to a list <code>zs</code>.</p>
<pre><code>append (fromList xs) (fromList ys) zs
(fromList xs) ((fromList ys) zs)
(fromList xs) ((\ws -&gt; ys ++ ws) zs)
(fromList xs) (ys ++ zs)
(\ws -&gt; xs ++ ws) (ys ++ zs)
xs ++ (ys ++ zs)</code></pre>
<p>So, when the time finally comes to compute the list concatenations, they end up being in the proper order!</p>
<h2 id="function-composition">Function Composition</h2>
<p>The operation <code>append</code> earlier actually ended up corresponding to a very common operation, that of <strong>function composition</strong>. In function composition you have two functions, and you build a new function from them by applying one function first, then applying the second function to the result of the first. This is so common that it has a simple notation, namely that of a single dot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">(.) ::</span> (b<span class="ot">-&gt;</span>c) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> c)
f <span class="fu">.</span> g <span class="fu">=</span> \x <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> f (g x)
<span class="co">-- Can also write as</span>
f <span class="fu">.</span> g x <span class="fu">=</span> f (g x)</code></pre></div>
<p>With this definition in mind, we could have defined <code>append</code> earlier as simply <code>append=(.)</code>.</p>
<p>As a trivial example of function composition, consider a linear function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">f x <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dv">3</span> <span class="fu">*</span> x <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can think of this function as a composition of two functions: We first multiply by 3, then we add 1. We can think of these two as sections. So a rather convoluted way of writing the above would have been:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">f <span class="fu">=</span> (<span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="dv">3</span> <span class="fu">*</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>This doesn’t really show the significance of this function, but it will hopefully help show a bit of the mechanics.</p>
<p>As another example, suppose we wanted to do the following: Write a function that given a list of numbers squares them then adds the results. We could write this in a number of different ways:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">sumSquares ::</span> <span class="dt">Num</span> t <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> [t] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> t
<span class="co">-- List comprehension</span>
sumSquares xs <span class="fu">=</span> sum [x<span class="fu">^</span><span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">|</span> x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> xs]
<span class="co">-- Using map</span>
sumSquares xs <span class="fu">=</span> sum (map (<span class="fu">^</span><span class="dv">2</span>) xs)
<span class="co">-- &quot;Point-free&quot; using function composition</span>
sumSquares <span class="fu">=</span> sum <span class="fu">.</span> map (<span class="fu">^</span><span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>This type of programming has a certain elegance to it: We define a function via composition of known functions, without ever having to mention the function’s actual parameter. This is often called <strong>point-free style</strong>, some times also called <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Give a point-free definition of a function that is given a list of numbers finds the maximum of the first 3 elements.</li>
<li>Give a point-free definition of a function that given a list of lists returns a list containing the heads of those lists (you do not need function composition here, this is simply a curried function with only some parameters provided).</li>
<li>Consider the following “string scrambling” process: For each character, convert it to an integer via the method <code>ord :: Char -&gt; Int</code>, then double that integer, finally convert the corresponding integer back to a character via <code>chr :: Int -&gt; Char</code>. Do this for each character in the string. This is a partially applied <code>map</code>, where the provided function is point-free and composes the functions <code>ord, chr</code> together with a section for the multiplication.</li>
</ol>
