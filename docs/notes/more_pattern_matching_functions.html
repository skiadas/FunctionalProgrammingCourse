<h2 id="practice-with-pattern-matching-and-function-parameters.">Practice with pattern matching and function parameters.</h2>
<p>The most common use of pattern-matching is in writing functions that process a list. We already saw a number of examples in that direction. The main elements of the process are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We handle in some special way the “base” cases of the empty list, and possibly the list of one element.</li>
<li>We handle the general case of a list with a head and a tail. This typically involves calling the function recursively onto the tail, then doing some more work with the result.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>map</code> function is a good example of this process:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map f []       = []
map f (x:xs)   = f x : map f xs</code></pre>
<p>Note the second case. We call <code>map f xs</code> to obtain the result for the tail of our list. Then we also compute <code>f x</code> and put it at the front of the list.</p>
<p>Let us also write the function <code>filter</code>: <code>filter</code> takes a predicate, which is a function of type <code>a -&gt; Bool</code>. Then it takes a list of values, applies the predicate to them, and only returns those for which the predicate is <code>True</code>. Here’s how that looks like:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
filter p []                 = []
filter p (x:xs) | p x       = x :: filter p xs
                | otherwise = filter p xs</code></pre>
<p>Let us look at some more examples. For instance let us write the function <code>take</code> that returns the first however many elements from a list. The logic would go like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If we are asked to take 0 or less elements, then we simply return the empty list.</li>
<li>If we are asked to take a number of elements from the empty list, then we simply return the empty list.</li>
<li>If we are asked to take <code>n</code> elements from a non-empty list, then we will take <code>n-1</code> elements from its tail, then append the head element.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us translate that into code:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
take _ []                   = []
take n (x:xs) | n &lt;= 0      = []
              | otherwise   = x : take (n-1) xs</code></pre>
<h3 id="practice-problems">Practice Problems</h3>
<p>You are expected to do these using pattern-matching and recursion as above, and not via other means.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Write a function <code>zipWith :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [c]</code>. It takes a function that turns an <code>a</code> and a <code>b</code> into a value of type <code>c</code>, and also takes a list of <code>a</code>s and a list of <code>b</code>s. It then forms a list out of the result of applying the function to the corresponding pairs of elements.</li>
<li>(difficult) Write a function <code>splitWith :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; ([a], [a])</code> which take as input a predicate and a list, and separates the list in two lists, with the first list containing those elements for which the predicate is <code>True</code> and the second list containing those elements for which the predicate is <code>False</code>. The order of elements must be maintained within each list.</li>
</ol>

let els = document.getElementsByTagName("pre");
for (const el of els) {
  const lang = el.getAttribute("class");
  if (lang != "") {
      el.children[0].setAttribute("class", "language-"+lang);
  }
