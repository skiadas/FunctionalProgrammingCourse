<h1 id="folding">Folding</h1>
<p>In this section we will look at the important idea of a folding operation, which provides a systematic way to process all elements in a list, or any other recursive structure. Folding effectively captures in a nicely generic way the idea of accumulating the values of a list/array.</p>
<h2 id="folding-lists">Folding Lists</h2>
<p>We start with a special case, called <code>foldr1</code>, which only works for lists that have at least one element. As an example, folding the addition operator over a list of numbers will result in adding those numbers:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldr1 (+) [1..5] = 1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5)))</code></pre>
<p>While the parentheses are not needed in this case, they indicate the way in which the function is applied.</p>
<p>As another example, we can implement the <code>minimum</code> function which finds the smallest element in an array simply as:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>minimum lst = foldr1 (min) lst</code></pre>
<p>where <code>min</code> is the function that given two numbers returns their maximum.</p>
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write a <code>foldr1</code> call which will determine if <em>all</em> the elements in a list of booleans are <code>True</code>, as well as one that will determine if <em>any</em> of them are <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>Write a <code>foldr1</code> call that will concatenate together a list of strings.</li>
<li>Determine the type of <code>foldr1</code> and then provide an implementation for it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="foldr">foldr</h2>
<p>A more general pattern is implemented via the function <code>foldr</code> (without the 1). This is the overall pattern we want to employ, which replicates the idea of accumulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to process the elements of a list of type <code>[a]</code> and return a value of a certain type <code>b</code>.</li>
<li>We have an initial value to get as the result for the case of the empty list.</li>
<li>For a non-empty list:
<ul>
<li>We get a value of type <code>b</code> from recursively working on the tail of the list.</li>
<li>We have a way to combine that value with the head of the list to produce a new value. This would be done via a function of type: <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; b</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many examples of this pattern: Computing the sum of numbers, the product of numbers, reversing a list, etc.</p>
<p>All these functions have the following “generic” implementation:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>f []     = v
f (x:xs) = x # f xs    -- &quot;#&quot; is the function a -&gt; b -&gt; b</code></pre>
<p>This is exactly what the function <code>foldr</code> does for us. Here is its type and definition:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b</code></pre>
<p>It takes in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>A function to be used for combining an <code>a</code> value with a <code>b</code> value, to produce a new <em>updated</em> <code>b</code> value.</li>
<li>An initial <code>b</code> value.</li>
<li><code>A list of</code>a` values to process.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is the implementation:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldr f v []     = v
foldr f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr f v xs)</code></pre>
<p>Visually you should think of <code>foldr (#) v</code> as replacing the list “colon” operator with <code>#</code>, and the empty list with <code>v</code>, like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>1 : (2 : (3 : []))     -- A list
1 # (2 # (3 # v))      -- The &quot;foldr (#) v&quot; of that list

As an example, `foldr (+) 0` is the same as `sum`:
```haskell
sum []     = 0
sum (x:xs) = (+) x (sum xs)   --- usually written as &quot;x + sum xs&quot;
-- visually:
1 + (2 + (3 + 0))</code></pre>
<p>Let us think of how we can write the function <code>map</code> using <code>foldr</code>. It would look in general something like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map f xs = foldr (\x ys -&gt; ...) [] xs</code></pre>
<p>where the function in the parentheses must be of type <code>a -&gt; [b] -&gt; [b]</code> (the “result type” that <code>foldr</code> calls <code>b</code> is in our case <code>[b]</code>).</p>
<p>So, we provide the empty list as an initial value: After all that should be the result if the <code>xs</code> is an empty list. Then we tell <code>foldr</code> that we will iterate over the list of the <code>xs</code>. Finally we need to tell it how to combine the current <code>a</code> value (<code>x</code>), and the list that is the result of processing the rest of the values, (<code>ys</code>), into the new list:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>map f xs = foldr (\x ys -&gt; f x : ys) [] xs
--- We can also write this as:
map f = foldr (\x ys -&gt; f x : ys) []
-- We can also write it as:
map f = foldr (\x -&gt; (f x :)) []</code></pre>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: Implement <code>length</code> and <code>filter</code> via <code>foldr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="foldl">foldl</h3>
<p><code>foldl</code> is the sibling of <code>foldr</code>. It performs a similar process but does so in the opposite direction, from left to right. Symbolically we could say something like:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldl (#) y [x1, x2, x3] = (((y # x1) # x2) # x3)</code></pre>
<p>Its type and standard implementation follow:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
foldl _ v []     = v
foldl f v (x:xs) = foldl f (f v x) xs</code></pre>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: Understand the above definition and make sure it typechecks.</p>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: Implement <code>reverse</code> using <code>foldl</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>reverse = foldl (\ys y -&gt; ...) []</code></pre>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: For those particularly motivated, there is a remarkable way to implement <code>foldl</code> via actually using <code>foldr</code>. The essential idea is to foldr appropriate functions, each new function building on the previous one. When these functions get called on the initial value, they end up performing the folds in the left-to-right order. If you are interested in learning more about this, here are two relevant links: <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldl_as_foldr_alternative">Foldl as foldr alternative</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold</a>. But for now here is the implementation (Just understanding how the types work is an exercise in its own right, note how <code>foldr</code> appears to be applied to 4 arguments!):</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>foldl f yinit xs = foldr construct id xs yinit
    where construct x g y = g (f y x)
          id y = y</code></pre>
