<h1 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h1>
<p>The second assignment has a dual purpose. The first is to get you started with using version control in order to manage a project. The other is for you to practice writing functions using pattern matches, and working with custom data types.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If you have not done so, you should follow the steps in <a href="../notes/version_control.html">the version control notes page</a> regarding setting up GitKraken and creating a GitLab account.</li>
<li>We will now clone the second assignment project via GitKraken, so that you have a local clone of your fork. Open up GitKraken if it is not open yet, and use the Folder icon in the top left, then choose “Clone”, then the GitLab.com tab, and then the <code>functional-programming-assignments</code> link.
<ul>
<li>Use the “Browse” button to choose where to clone this repository. This is the parent folder for the project. The cloning process will create a new folder for you within this parent folder.</li>
<li>Click “Clone the repo!” to create the repository.</li>
<li>Choose “Open Now” from the flash message at the top.</li>
<li>You should now be looking at the commits log for the project. As you work on your project, you will be adding your own commits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We now have a local clone of the project on your college account. Navigate to that folder from the terminal, then type <code>subl .</code> to open that folder up in Sublime Text.</li>
<li>The GitLab webpage for the project, either your fork or the original, contains a <code>README.md</code> file within the <code>assignment2</code> folder. This file contains the instructions on what functions you need to implemement.</li>
<li>Follow the commit workflow described in the <a href="../notes/version_control.html">the version control notes page</a> to create commits as you work on your project. Don’t forget that you want to make commits that are “atomic”, i.e. all the parts committed together form a cohesive whole that addresses one issue.</li>
<li>For this assignment, you do not need to worry about issue management if you do not want to.</li>
<li>“Submit” the assignment by adding your instructor as a Reporter (Settings -&gt; Members on the left toolbar) to your repositories.</li>
</ol>
