<h1 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h1>
<p>The first assignment is meant to give you practice in writing simple Haskell functions. A code snippet at the end of this document contains the starting code for your assignment.</p>
<p>This assignment deals with a “Person” type. A person is simply a tuple <code>(String, Int, Gender)</code> where the first coordinate is the person’s name, the second is their age in years and the last is their gender, which can take one of the values <code>Male</code> or <code>Female</code> (no quotes around them). An example of one student (Susie) is provided.</p>
<p>You will write a series of functions that operate on persons. Here are some things to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each function starts with its type/signature. These are commented out so that you can compile the script file. Uncomment the function type when you start working with it.</li>
<li>The first couple of functions also provide a start point with the first line of the function definition. You should also uncomment those when you start working on the function.</li>
<li>Use good names for the variables you use in your function. Camel-case them where appropriate.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the form of the function: Avoid very long or complicated expression.</li>
<li>Many functions are meant to use previously defined functions. Pay attention to these opportunities.</li>
<li>Most of your answers will be one-liners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description-of-functions-to-write">Description of functions to write</h2>
<p>We describe here the functions that you have to write.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first function is provided for you. It is a function called <code>name</code> that returns the person’s name. As you can see it is extremely short</li>
<li>Write a function <code>age</code> that given a person returns their age, and similarly a function <code>gender</code> that given a person returns their gender.</li>
<li>Write functions <code>isMale</code> and <code>isFemale</code> which return a boolean depending on whether the person is male or female. You can do this with or without using the <code>gender</code> function. We have written two different start forms depending on which approach you want to take.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>canDrink</code> that given a person returns whether that person is old enough to legally drink (i.e. 21 or above).</li>
<li>Write a function <code>closeAge</code> that takes two (curried) <code>Person</code> arguments and returns whether their ages are within 2 years of each other.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>oppositeGender</code> that takes two (curried) <code>Person</code> arguments and returns whether they are of opposite gender.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>bioCompatible</code> that takes two person arguments and returns whether they are “biologically compatible”, which for the purposes of the assignment we define as “at most 2 years apart and of opposite gender”.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>allAges</code> that given a list of <code>Person</code>s returns a list of their ages. Use the <code>map</code> function for it.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>sumOfAges</code> that given a list of <code>Person</code>s returns the sum of their ages. You can do this by using the <code>allAges</code> function along with the built-in <code>sum</code> function.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>allCanDrink</code> that given a list of <code>Person</code>s returns whether they are all eligible to drink. You will find the function <code>all</code> useful. It has signature <code>all :: (a-&gt;Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code>. So it takes a function that to each <code>a</code> returns a boolean (such functions are called predicates), then it takes a list of <code>a</code>s, and applies the function to all of them and determines if they were all <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>ageOne</code> that “ages” a person by one year. It should keep all other information about a person the same, but increase their age by 1. It returns the “new” person.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>ageAll</code> that takes a list of <code>Person</code>s and ages them all by 1, and returns the new list of aged <code>Person</code>s.</li>
<li>Use guarded expressions to write a function <code>isYoung</code> that takes a person and returns a string as follows: If the person is at most 5 years old the string should be <code>"a toddler"</code>. If they are at most 18 years old it should be <code>"a teenager"</code>. If they are over 18 years old it should be <code>"young at heart"</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>describe</code> which given a person “describes” them by producing a string as follows: <code>"This is &lt;name&gt;. He/She is "</code> and then the result of the <code>isYoung</code> function. Finally a closing dot at the end. You should use the appropriate pronoun for the given gender. Think of breaking this function up in smaller pieces using <code>where</code>. Remember that you can use <code>++</code> to concatenate lists, in particular to concatenate strings.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>makePerson</code> that is given a pair of a name and a gender and creates a new person with age <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>makeMany</code> that is given a list of names and a list of genders, and produces a list of new people at age 0 from the corresponding pairs. You will want to use <code>zip</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>makePerson</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="starting-code">Starting code</h1>
<p>Copy this code and save it into a new Haskell script file. It should have the extension <code>.hs</code> and it should have a filename of the form: <code>LastnameFirstname1.hs</code>. Email me this file to submit your assignment.</p>
