<h1 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h1>
<p>The first assignment is meant to give you practice in writing simple Haskell functions. A code snippet at the end of this document contains the starting code for your assignment.</p>
<p>This assignment deals with a “Pet” type. A pet is simply a tuple <code>(String, Int, Species)</code> where the first coordinate is the pet’s name, the second is their age in years and the last is their species, which can take one of the values <code>Cat</code> or <code>Dog</code> (no quotes around them). An example of one pet is provided.</p>
<p>You will write a series of functions that operate on pets. Here are some things to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each function starts with its type/signature. These are commented out so that you can compile the script file. Uncomment the function type when you start working with it.</li>
<li>The first couple of functions also provide a start point with the first line of the function definition. You should also uncomment those when you start working on the function.</li>
<li>Use good names for the variables you use in your function. Camel-case them where appropriate.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the form of the function: Avoid very long or complicated expression.</li>
<li>Many functions are meant to use previously defined functions. Pay attention to these opportunities.</li>
<li>Most of your answers will be one-liners.</li>
<li>Use <em>list comprehensions</em> for the problems asking you to work with lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description-of-functions-to-write">Description of functions to write</h2>
<p>We describe here the functions that you have to write.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first function is provided for you. It is a function called <code>name</code> that returns the pet’s name. As you can see it is extremely short</li>
<li>Write a function <code>age</code> that given a pet returns their age, and similarly a function <code>species</code> that given a pet returns their species.</li>
<li>Write functions <code>isCat</code> and <code>isDog</code> which return a boolean depending on whether the pet is cat or dog. You can do this with or without using the <code>species</code> function. We have written two different start forms depending on which approach you want to take.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>isOld</code> that given a pet returns whether that pet is “old”. We define old for dogs as being at least 10 years of age, and for cats as at least 11 years of age.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>closeAge</code> that takes two <code>pet</code> arguments and returns whether their ages are within 2 years of each other.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>differentSpecies</code> that takes two <code>pet</code> arguments and returns whether they are different species.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>opposites</code> that takes two pet arguments and returns whether they are “opposites”, which for the purposes of the assignment we define as “at most 2 years apart and of different species”.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>allAges</code> that given a list of <code>pet</code>s returns a list of their ages.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>sumOfAges</code> that given a list of <code>pet</code>s returns the sum of their ages. You can do this by using the <code>allAges</code> function along with the built-in <code>sum</code> function which adds up all numbers in a list.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>allOld</code> that given a list of <code>pet</code>s returns whether they are all old. Use the function <code>isOld</code> with a list comprehension, which should produce a list of booleans, then combine that with the <code>and</code> function, which takes a list of booleans and looks at their “AND”, i.e. whether they are all true.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>ageOne</code> that “ages” a pet by one year. It should keep all other information about a pet the same, but increase their age by 1. It returns the “new” pet.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>ageAll</code> that takes a list of <code>pet</code>s and ages them all by 1, and returns the new list of aged <code>pet</code>s.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>describe</code> that takes a pet and returns a string as follows: It will produce one of the messages <code>"young cat"</code>, <code>"young dog"</code>, <code>"old cat"</code>, <code>"old dog"</code> depending on whether the pet is a cat or a dog and whether they are old as described above. You can use helper functions defined in a <code>where</code> clause.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>introduce</code> which given a pet “introduces” them by producing a string as follows: <code>"This is &lt;name&gt;. &lt;name&gt; is a "</code> and then the result of the <code>describe</code> function. Finally a closing dot at the end. Remember that you can use <code>++</code> to concatenate lists, in particular to concatenate strings.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>makePet</code> that is given a pair of a name and a species and creates a new pet with age <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>makeMany</code> that is given a list of pairs of a name and a species, and produces a list of new pets at age 0 from the corresponding pairs. You will want to use list comprehensions along with <code>makePet</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="starting-code">Starting code</h1>
<p>Copy this code and save it into a new Haskell script file. It should have the extension <code>.hs</code> and it should have a filename of the form: <code>LastnameFirstname1.hs</code>. Email me this file to submit your assignment.</p>
